# Automation Projects

Welcome to my Automation Projects repository! This repo is designed to showcase my skills in modern test automation, API testing, and framework design using industry-standard tools like Playwright and Postman. It is structured for clarity, scalability, and real-world relevance.

## Projects & Structure

### 1. `playwright-portfolio/`

Multi-project Playwright automation suite, organized for scalability:

- **rahulshetty/**: End-to-end and API tests for the Automation Exercise site, using Page Object Model, data-driven tests, and Playwright best practices.
- **demo-site/**: Playwright tests for a custom demo web app (see below), designed to showcase advanced UI automation scenarios.
- **Multi-project config**: Easily run tests for each project with Playwright's multi-project setup.

### 2. `postman-portfolio/`

Robust API tests using Postman collections:

- Chained API requests, dynamic variables, and automated assertions.
- Example: Library API (add, get, delete book).

### 3. `playwright-demo-site/`

Live demo site for Playwright UI automation, hosted on GitHub Pages:

- Interactive forms (login, registration, contact)
- Advanced UI elements (dropdowns, tooltips, modals, file upload, dark/light mode, spinners)
- LocalStorage and SessionStorage scenarios
- **[üåê View Live Demo](https://padraic79.github.io/AutomationProjects/)**
