## üöÄ How to Run Locally

**To view the live demo:**

- Visit [https://padraic79.github.io/AutomationProjects/](https://padraic79.github.io/AutomationProjects/)

**To enable login/register and API features locally:**

1. Clone the repo and run the backend:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Padraic79/AutomationProjects.git
   cd AutomationProjects/backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
2. (Optional) Update `API_BASE` in `docs/script.js` to `http://localhost:4000` if testing locally.
3. Serve the frontend with a local web server (e.g. `npx serve docs`).

## üß™ Automated UI Tests (Playwright)
