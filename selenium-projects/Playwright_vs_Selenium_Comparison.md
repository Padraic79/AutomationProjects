I created it for my own learning and projects. It includes detailed examples, explanations, and extra notes to help me build my skills and remember important concepts as I work through real-world automation projects.

## 10. Practical Tips for Learning

- **Start simple:** Write basic tests that open a page and check the title.
- **Iterate:** Add more actions (clicks, form fills, assertions) as you learn.
- **Read docs:** Explore [Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) and [Selenium docs](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/).
- **Experiment:** Try running tests in headed/headless mode, add waits, and handle errors.
- **Ask for help:** Use forums, GitHub issues, or Stack Overflow if you get stuck.
- **Show your work:** Document your learning and share your repo with others.
